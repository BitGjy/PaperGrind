main method: Autoencoder, GAN

This work uses GAN to solve the sparse sample problem in the traditional
Network Embedding algorithms that start with Random Walks. GAN is to used
to extract useful information and at the same time address the overfitting
problem on sparsely sampled walks by providing more robust discrete-space
representation learning.
